## Introduction
Hi! My name is Wren Warnock. Iâ€™m a 12th grader at Indiana Connections High School and a second year computer science student at Southern Indiana Career & Technical School. I aspire to be a software engineer, study astrophysics, and pursue video game design and development as a hobby.
