## My Philosophy
*"The only way to live in an unfree world is to become so absolutely free that your very existence is an act of rebellion. Because it isn't meaninglessness that hurts, it's the contradiction of needing meaning and not getting it"* -Albert Camus

*"Nothing will last forever and maybe we'll never understand what the world is here for or what we're here for but we can live even more intensely. Instead of gazing into the abyss, I will maintain uncomfortable eye contact with it. This is the burden of freedom. This is the weight of being. This is absurdism."* - Exurb1a

## Favorite Quotes
"Perhaps there's a holy watcher in the sky, perhaps we're an alien experiment, perhaps it's all just atoms and chance but who can be sure? Not **us**. Not **yet** at least. But we can **dance** in the mystery, absurdism says, with the dance as the point all along." -Exurb1a

"Science has not yet taught us if madness is or is not the **sublimity** of the intelligence" -Edgar Allen Poe
